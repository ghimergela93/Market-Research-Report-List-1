<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Control and Slow-release Fertiliser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Slow-release Fertiliser</li><li>Control-release Fertiliser</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The control and slow-release fertilizer market is segmented into two main types: slow-release fertilizers and control-release fertilizers. Slow-release fertilizers gradually release nutrients over an extended period, providing plants with a steady supply, which reduces the risk of nutrient leaching and enhances efficiency. Conversely, control-release fertilizers are designed to release nutrients in response to environmental factors like temperature and moisture, ensuring optimal nutrient availability aligned with plant needs. Both types promote sustainable agriculture and enhance crop yields while minimizing environmental impact.</p></p>
