<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Surgery Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Atrial Fibrillation (AF) surgery devices market includes two primary types: catheter ablation and maze surgery. Catheter ablation utilizes thin, flexible tubes to destroy small areas of heart tissue that cause irregular rhythms, offering a minimally invasive approach with quicker recovery. Maze surgery, on the other hand, involves creating scar tissue through incisions in the heart to block abnormal electrical signals, typically requiring more extensive surgical intervention. Both methods aim to restore normal heart rhythm and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
